### Concept

All too often, we order something from our favorite fashion outlets, only to find that a `Medium` in one brand feels a lot more like an `XXL` in another.

_Does It Fit_ is a website aimed at solving just that problem. By gathering reviews from millions of users on 233,621 products and 194 retailers (and counting!), _Does It Fit_ sheds some light on whether that funky tanktop you've been eyeing will fit you just right.

### Functionality Overview

* Users can register and submit reviews and ratings on the fit of a particular product
* Products can be accessed by brand or category
* Other users can then vote on whether they find a review helpful or not helpful - telling other users which reviews are most informative
